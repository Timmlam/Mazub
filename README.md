# Mazub
The mazub project is a simple adventure game (like Mario bros) made for the course "Object oriented programming" at the KU Leuven. It is implemented in Java. For the project, an interface was given in src-provided. The self made code can be found in the src folder. This project was created by Maarten Volkaerts en Timm Lamberechts.
